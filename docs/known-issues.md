# Known Issues & Cross-Phase Concerns

A lightweight tracker for bugs, design questions, and tech debt that are **not tied to a
single phase** — the local stand-in for an issue tracker until the project is hosted
(then these can migrate to GitHub Issues).

**Lifecycle:** an item lives here while it is open. When it is resolved, it moves to the
**Fixed** (or Changed) section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) and is removed from
here. Phase-specific work belongs in [`plans/orion-plan.md`](../plans/orion-plan.md), not
here.

**Fields per entry:** a stable id, a one-line title, the detail, *why it matters*, a
severity (low / medium / high), and a status (Open / Needs decision / Monitored /
Deferred).

---

## KI-1 — Multi-recipient partial-failure policy

- **Detail:** When a project has several recipients and some deliveries fail, the current
  policy advances state if **at least one** send succeeds. The conservative alternative
  is to advance only if **all** succeed.
- **Why it matters:** Advancing on partial success means a recipient who failed never
  receives the activity that was covered by that run — it silently falls into the gap
  between reports. Advancing only on full success risks re-sending to recipients who
  already got it. Neither is obviously right; it needs a deliberate choice (possibly
  per-recipient state).
- **Severity:** medium
- **Status:** Needs decision (flagged in the plan's Phase 1 edge-case table).

## KI-2 — Discord message truncation is lossy

- **Detail:** Messages over Discord's 2000-character limit are truncated with a marker
  rather than split across multiple messages.
- **Why it matters:** A long (but already redacted) report loses its tail. Splitting into
  multiple messages would preserve everything; truncation was chosen as the simplest
  correct behavior for Phase 1.
- **Severity:** low
- **Status:** Deferred (enhancement).

## KI-3 — Redaction pattern set is inherently incomplete

- **Detail:** `redact._PATTERNS` is a living list of known secret shapes. No regex set can
  match every possible secret, so false negatives are always possible.
- **Why it matters:** Redaction is one layer of defense in depth, not a guarantee. The
  guaranteeing layer is the human preview-before-send. This entry exists to keep the risk
  visible and the pattern list under periodic review, and to resist any future change that
  would treat redaction as a sufficient control on its own.
- **Severity:** ongoing / by-design
- **Status:** Monitored.

## KI-4 — Haiku summary quality not yet empirically confirmed on varied diffs

- **Detail:** The summarizer uses Claude Haiku 4.5 (the lightest adequate model). It has
  produced good summaries on the small test repo, but has not been evaluated on large or
  messy real-world diffs.
- **Why it matters:** The plan commits to stepping up to Sonnet 4.6 *only if* Haiku
  visibly misses nuance. That decision should be made from real evidence, not assumed.
- **Severity:** low
- **Status:** Open (evaluate on real projects during Phase 1 use).

## KI-5 — `compose()` silently falls through for unknown channels

- **Detail:** `compose.compose()` returns Markdown for any unrecognized `channel` value
  rather than raising. Config validation already restricts `channel` to supported values
  upstream, so this is currently unreachable.
- **Why it matters:** It is a small latent foot-gun: if a future channel is added to
  config validation but not to `compose`, it would silently get Markdown formatting
  instead of an error. Low priority while Discord is the only channel.
- **Severity:** low
- **Status:** Open (revisit when Slack is added in Phase 3).

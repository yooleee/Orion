# Responsible for: The `orion` command and the end-to-end orchestration of one
#                  report run. This is the ONLY module that knows the full
#                  pipeline order.
# Role in project: Ties every other module together:
#   config -> secrets -> state -> collect -> redact -> (LLM | passthrough)
#   -> redact -> build report -> compose -> preview/confirm -> deliver -> advance.
# Design: the orchestrator is where the pipeline grows. In Phase 2 it gains a loop
#   over multiple collectors + a merge step; every other module's signature stays
#   put. The lane branch below is the real conditional-LLM seam (the `else` is
#   dead in Phase 1 but makes the seam concrete).
# Fail-closed: any error before delivery aborts the run and does NOT advance
#   state, so a retry re-reports the same delta. State advances only after at
#   least one successful send.

    Why:
        On Windows, when output is redirected to a pipe or file, Python encodes
        with the locale ANSI code page (often cp1252), which cannot represent the
        status glyphs we print ("⚠", "✗") — printing one then raises
        UnicodeEncodeError and aborts the run. (To an interactive Windows console
        Python 3.6+ writes via WriteConsoleW, so the glyphs are already fine
        there; the crash is specifically the redirected case.) Forcing UTF-8
        removes that crash while keeping the glyphs on capable terminals. We guard
        two ways because neither should ever break the CLI: `reconfigure` is
        absent on non-TextIOWrapper streams (pytest's capture, embedded
        interpreters like IDLE), and on an unusual stream it can raise. A real end
        user always has a reconfigurable stream; the guards exist for those

    Why:
        Both cmd_report and cmd_intake deliver the same way — for each recipient,

        failure not abort the others. Routing lives here (one place, DRY); each

    Why:
        The collectors legitimately take different arguments (git wants a repo and
